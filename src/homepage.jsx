        <h2>Hello!</h2>
        <h3>I'm Anastasia, a San-Francisco-based Frontend engineer.</h3>
        <img src="https://i.imgur.com/1jWDvaL.png"alt=""/>
        <p>Fluent in English, Russian and Portuguese, I am eager to explore new technology.
        </p>
        <p>I have strong critical thinking skills and the ability to learn new concepts and solve problems thoughtfully and effectively, 
          I know how to identify challenges and solutions. 
          My involvement in academia has equipped me with skills essential to successful achievement of professional goals.
        </p>
        <p>I independently conduct comprehensive research and analysis 
          (e.g. legislation, policies, reports). My drafting strives to being impeccable,
          allowing me to outline complex texts, tailed for specific aim and audience.
        </p>
        <p>My experience helped me to gain perfect communication skills, to learn how to deal with different issues (i.e. legal), 
          and to be confident in the project activities. The knowledge of English, French, Brazilian and
          Russian legal systems and legal vocabulary allows me to work with any legal documents and to be flexible and 
          openminded when it comes to interaction with people from different countries and backgrounds.
